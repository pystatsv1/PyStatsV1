Teaching guide
==============

PyStatsV1 is designed to be used in courses, workshops, and self-study settings.

Case study template
-------------------

The repository provides a case study template at::

   docs/case_study_template.md

This template outlines:

- Learning objectives
- Data description
- Analysis steps
- Discussion questions

Recommended workflow
--------------------

- Choose a chapter that matches your lesson (e.g., A/B testing, mixed models, reliability).
- Duplicate the case study template and adapt it to your context.
- Use the chapter scripts as the underlying code for demos or assignments.
- Encourage students to run the scripts locally and experiment with variations.

If you are using PyStatsV1 in teaching, we would love to hear from you via GitHub Discussions (``Teaching stories``) or an issue titled ``Course report: <institution>``.
