Business Chapter 4 — Assets (Inventory, Fixed Assets, Depreciation, Leases)
==========================================================================

This chapter extends Track D from the LedgerLab “starter month” into a **running case**:
North Shore Outfitters (NSO). The focus is on **assets** and why classification matters.

Learning objectives
-------------------

- Classify assets and explain why classification affects reporting and forecasting.
- Explain inventory’s role in COGS and gross margin.
- Compute and record straight-line depreciation; interpret its effects.
- Distinguish capex vs expense with practical decision rules.

Dataset (NSO v1)
----------------

Generated by: ``scripts/sim_business_nso_v1.py``

Written to: ``data/synthetic/nso_v1/``

Tables (v1 minimum):

- ``chart_of_accounts.csv``
- ``gl_journal.csv``
- ``trial_balance_monthly.csv``
- ``statements_is_monthly.csv``
- ``statements_bs_monthly.csv``
- ``statements_cf_monthly.csv``

Ch04 subledgers:

- ``inventory_movements.csv`` (purchase / sale_issue / count_adjustment)
- ``fixed_assets.csv`` (asset register)
- ``depreciation_schedule.csv`` (monthly straight-line schedule)

How to run
----------

.. code-block:: bash

   make business-nso-sim
   make business-ch04

Refresher: inventory, COGS, and margin
--------------------------------------

In a perpetual inventory system:

- Purchases increase Inventory.
- Sales create Revenue (cash or A/R).
- The matching COGS entry reduces Inventory and records an Expense.

Gross Profit = Sales – COGS
Gross Margin % = Gross Profit / Sales

Count adjustments
-----------------

A physical count can reveal shrinkage (inventory missing) or overage.
In this simplified teaching dataset, count adjustments post to COGS.

Refresher: fixed assets and depreciation
----------------------------------------

Capex vs expense decision rules (practical):

- **Expense**: benefits are consumed quickly (often within a year), or the item is minor.
- **Capex**: benefits extend across periods; track it on the balance sheet and depreciate.

Straight-line depreciation:

Monthly Depreciation = (Cost – Salvage Value) / Useful Life (months)

Key insight: depreciation reduces **net income**, but not **cash** in the period.
That’s why cash-flow style bridges add it back in CFO.

What the automated checks verify (exactly)
------------------------------------------

The Chapter 4 lab computes rollforwards and validates:

- Inventory subledger ties to ending Inventory on the balance sheet (each month).
- COGS implied by inventory movements ties to COGS on the income statement (each month).
- Depreciation schedule ties to GL depreciation expense (each month).
- Accumulated depreciation schedule ties to the balance sheet accum dep line (each month, absolute value).

End-of-chapter problems (suggested)
-----------------------------------

1) Inventory scenario:
   Show how purchase/sale/count adjustments affect COGS and gross margin.

2) Capex vs expense:
   Classify 10 borderline purchases and defend each decision.

3) Asset register:
   Build a small register and compute monthly depreciation (straight-line).
