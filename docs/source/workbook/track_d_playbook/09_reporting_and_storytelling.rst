Reporting: turning outputs into decisions
=========================================

**Why this exists:** Students often stop at plots. This chapter outlines the "so what?" layer Track D is aiming for.

Learning objectives
-------------------

- Write short, evidence-based interpretations (not just numbers).
- Choose plots/tables that match the question.
- Communicate uncertainty and limitations clearly.

Outline
-------

A simple reporting template
---------------------------

- Question → method → key results → interpretation → next step.
- Use the chapter's ``*_summary.json`` + (when present) ``*_memo.md`` / ``*_executive_memo.md`` as your starting draft.
- Include 1–2 plots and 1 table, not 10.

What makes a good figure
------------------------

- Readable axes, clear labels, one message per chart.
- Show comparisons (before/after, categories, distributions).

Common reporting failures
-------------------------

- Too many metrics with no narrative.
- No context: missing denominators, time windows, or baselines.
- Confusing accounting signs (debit/credit) with “good/bad”.
- Always state the sign convention you’re using (e.g., “positive = revenue inflow”).

Where this connects in the workbook
-----------------------------------

- :doc:`../track_d_byod_gnucash_demo_analysis` (example: daily totals → plots → interpretation)
- :doc:`../track_d_outputs_guide` (artifact types and how to use them)
- :doc:`../track_d_chapter_index` (see D09 for the plotting/reporting style contract)

.. note::

   This page is intentionally an outline right now. Expand it incrementally as we refine Track D narrative.
