Track C Workbook – Psychology & Experimental Design
===================================================

Track C is the **Psychology / Research Methods** track.
Each chapter page links to a runnable "problem set" script and a small test file.

How to use these chapters
-------------------------

- Read the chapter page.
- Run the corresponding script (or ``make`` target).
- Inspect the output tables / plots.
- Run the matching ``pytest`` file to check your work.

Chapter list
------------

The Track C problem-set pages currently live **outside** the workbook subtree.
When building only the workbook docs (``docs/source/workbook``), those pages may
not be available, so we don’t include them in a ``toctree`` here yet.
