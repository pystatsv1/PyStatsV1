Track D – Business Statistics & Forecasting for Accountants
==========================================================

Track D teaches **statistics and forecasting** to learners in accounting-adjacent
majors and jobs (bookkeeping, AP/AR, payroll, staff accounting, finance ops).

PyStatsV1’s value proposition
----------------------------

PyStatsV1 is built around one idea:

**Don’t just calculate your results — engineer them. We treat statistical analysis like production software.**

For accounting work, that means:

* **Reproducibility**: seeded simulations, saved artifacts, and deterministic reruns.
* **Traceability**: inputs → transformations → outputs (audit-trail thinking).
* **Controls awareness**: reconciliation checks and “what could go wrong?” baked in.
* **Decision focus**: every chapter ends with a short memo-style interpretation.

How the accounting refresher fits (motivator)
-------------------------------------------

Track D continuously refreshes four foundations that motivate why statistics matters:

1. **Bookkeeping basics**: accounting as measurement; double-entry; the general ledger.
2. **Assets**: inventory control; depreciation; capex vs expense.
3. **Liabilities & equity**: AP; debt; payroll/taxes; equity and retained earnings.
4. **Financial statement analysis**: bank reconciliation; ratios; trends; variance.

These are reinforced “just in time” inside the statistics and forecasting chapters.

The running dataset: LedgerLab
------------------------------

Track D uses a synthetic, accounting-shaped dataset called **LedgerLab**. It resembles
exports from common bookkeeping tools:

* chart of accounts
* journal/GL detail (debits/credits)
* simple monthly statements

Later chapters add AR/AP, payroll, inventory movements, and bank reconciliation.
