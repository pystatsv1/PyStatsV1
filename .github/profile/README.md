\# PyStatsV1 Organization



> Applied statistics in plain Python — cross-disciplinary, reproducible, and beginner-friendly.



Welcome! \*\*PyStatsV1\*\* is an open-source organization focused on \*\*applied statistics education\*\*.



Our flagship repository is:



\- \*\*\[PyStatsV1/PyStatsV1](https://github.com/pystatsv1/PyStatsV1)\*\*  

&nbsp; Chapter-based Python scripts that mirror classical R textbook analyses, with:

&nbsp; - synthetic teaching data,

&nbsp; - reproducible figures and JSON outputs,

&nbsp; - Makefile targets and CI smoke tests for each chapter.

\## What we care about



\- 🎓 \*\*Teaching statistics with real code\*\*  

&nbsp; Textbook-style examples implemented as plain, inspectable Python scripts.



\- 🔁 \*\*Building a bridge between R and Python\*\*  

&nbsp; Many classic applied stats texts are R-first; PyStatsV1 offers line-by-line Python counterparts.



\- 🧪 \*\*Reproducible workflows\*\*  

&nbsp; Makefiles, CI, and synthetic data so results can be rerun, checked, and reused.



\- 🤝 \*\*A welcoming community\*\*  

&nbsp; Clear CONTRIBUTING guidelines, “good first issues,” and mentor-style code review.

\## Who should get involved?



\- \*\*Students\*\* learning applied statistics or data analysis.

\- \*\*Instructors / TAs\*\* who want classroom-ready demos and synthetic datasets.

\- \*\*Practitioners\*\* who prefer scripts and CLIs over heavy frameworks.

\- \*\*R users\*\* who want a gentle path into Python-based workflows.



You don’t need to be a statistics expert to contribute — we have issues across a range of difficulty levels (docs, tests, refactors, new examples).

\## How to get started



1\. Visit \*\*\[PyStatsV1/PyStatsV1](https://github.com/pystatsv1/PyStatsV1)\*\*.

2\. Read the \*\*README\*\* and \*\*\[CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/pystatsv1/PyStatsV1/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)\*\*.

3\. Look for issues labeled `good first issue` or `help wanted`.

4\. Open an issue if you’d like to propose a new chapter or case study.

\## Roadmap (high level)



See the repo-level \*\*\[ROADMAP.md](https://github.com/pystatsv1/PyStatsV1/blob/main/ROADMAP.md)\*\* for details, but at a glance:



\- Expand regression chapters (logistic, Poisson, etc.).

\- Add power and sample size simulations.

\- Add more epidemiology-focused examples (risk ratios, odds ratios).

\- Grow a library of teaching case studies and chapter-specific docs.



If you’re an educator and want to align your course with PyStatsV1, we’d love to hear from you via a GitHub issue.

\## Stay tuned



As the organization grows, we plan to:



\- Enable GitHub Discussions for Q\&A and design ideas.

\- Publish Sphinx-based documentation on Read the Docs.

\- Highlight courses and institutions using PyStatsV1.



If you care about \*\*open, reproducible statistics education\*\*, you’re in the right place. 💙
