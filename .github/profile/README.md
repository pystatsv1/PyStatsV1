# PyStatsV1 Organization
**Don't just calculate your results — engineer them.**

PyStatsV1 is an open-source organization applying modern software engineering
standards to applied statistics.  
Our mission is to help students, instructors, and researchers escape the
*Reproducibility Crisis* by treating statistical analysis not as a scratchpad,
but as a transparent, testable, and re-runnable system.

**PyStatsV1 = statistics + software engineering for transparent and reproducible research.**

### 🚩 Flagship Repository  
**https://github.com/pystatsv1/PyStatsV1**

A chapter-based applied statistics toolkit in plain Python.

- **For Researchers:** “Audit-proof” pipelines with version control, tests, and one-command regeneration.
- **For Students:** Learn statistics using clean Python scripts that mirror textbook chapters.
- **For Instructors:** Standardized Makefile workflows and CI smoke tests make grading and replication easy.
